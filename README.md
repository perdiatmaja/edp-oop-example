OOP Concepts Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concept in Java. OOP have 6 basic concepts, that is:

Class Blueprint of object that has relationship inside it. Example: Class Vehicle has object machine, driver, what make they move.
Object Form or entity or property but not method. Example: example like above.
Inheritance Child that can have all public or protected properties (property, method). Example: Like vehicle has driver, then any class that inheritance it will have driver too like car or bus.
Polymorphism In java it mean a function that will have multiple implementation.
Abstraction Hiding internal details and showing functionality that must implemented is known as abstraction.
Encapsulation This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods. It’s a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. Actually there are 2 protective barrier that is private and protected. The private one can only be accessed by class itself, but the protected one can be accessed by class itself and the child class.
